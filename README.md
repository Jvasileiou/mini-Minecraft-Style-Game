### Description
It is a "3D Stage" MineCraft game. The scene consists of a conspicuous 3D grid (X, Y, Z) of dimensions NxNxN, where at each position of the grid can be placed a small piece with some color in a manner determined by the game. The mesh positions are from 1 .. N in each dimension. N will enter your program. The idea of the game is that the player is initially placed on a floor of cubes of a different color and moves to the floor by building, wiping, raising, lowering or falling. The player is one and starts with 100 points and 4 lives. The game lasts as long as the player has lives. The aim is to bring the player as many units as possible. Functions that require cubes / cylinders or units are only available if there is a corresponding inventory. The player collect virtual cubes and cylinders by creating a stock with which he can later build blocks and cylinders.
